This project allows an IBM 1130 to protect the rare disk heads and physical 2315 disk cartridges from crashes, while still making use of the disk drive and experiencing the sounds and vibrations associated with the drive.

A switch and small physical modification to the drive allows it to be switched between real and virtual mode, where the heads are loaded and active in real mode or they remain above the surface and our facility takes over the bit stream.
