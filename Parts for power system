Here are the places where I ordered the parts for the power system

12V battery - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00K8V30D0?ref=nb_sb_ss_w_as-reorder_k3_1_11&amp=&crid=33UW8GSNM36RI&sprefix=12v%2Bbattery&th=1
charger/maintainer - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074KK8RCW?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_2
ride-through timer - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BFG772Z9?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_1

Any suitable alternative could be used.
