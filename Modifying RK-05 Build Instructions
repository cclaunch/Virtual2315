When building the RK-05 Emulator purchased from George Wiley,
use his instructions but apply these modifications:

1 The dress faceplate in his kit is to be replaced by the 
Virtual 2315 Cartridge Facility dress plate

2 If implementing the Mini 2315 Cartridge objects,
do not install the SD card PCB into the RK-05 Emulator.
Instead, attach the ribbon connector with the key downward,
flush with the front of the dress faceplate. I used a zip tie, 
other choices are possible.

3 The terminator board needs to add a 383Î© resistor for AU1
to properly terminate that signal line.
